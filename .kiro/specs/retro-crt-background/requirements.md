# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current static background image with a dynamic, code-generated retro CRT terminal-style background that includes animated scanlines, phosphor glow effects, and terminal-like visual elements to enhance the game's aesthetic appeal.

## Glossary

- **CRT_Background_System**: The complete background rendering system that generates retro terminal visual effects
- **Scanline_Animation**: Moving horizontal lines that simulate CRT monitor scanning behavior
- **Phosphor_Glow**: Green-tinted glow effects that simulate old terminal phosphor displays
- **Terminal_Grid**: Static horizontal lines that simulate terminal text rows
- **Vignette_Effect**: Darkened edges that simulate CRT monitor curvature and aging

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a dynamic retro CRT background instead of a static image, so that the game feels more immersive and visually engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads, THE CRT_Background_System SHALL render a black base background with green phosphor effects
2. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL display static horizontal grid lines across the entire screen to simulate terminal rows
3. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL apply a vignette effect to darken the screen edges
4. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL maintain consistent visual quality across all screen sizes
5. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL not interfere with game UI element readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see animated scanlines moving across the screen, so that the background feels alive and authentic to retro CRT monitors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL display at least one moving scanline that travels from top to bottom
2. WHEN a scanline reaches the bottom of the screen, THE CRT_Background_System SHALL reset it to the top position
3. THE Scanline_Animation SHALL complete a full cycle in 2-4 seconds for optimal visual effect
4. THE Scanline_Animation SHALL use smooth linear transitions without stuttering
5. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL render scanlines with appropriate opacity to avoid overwhelming the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the background effects to be performance-optimized, so that the game runs smoothly on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL use CSS animations instead of JavaScript for better performance
2. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL limit the number of animated elements to prevent performance degradation
3. WHEN running on mobile devices, THE CRT_Background_System SHALL maintain 60fps performance
4. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL use hardware acceleration where available
5. THE CRT_Background_System SHALL not cause memory leaks during extended gameplay sessions
