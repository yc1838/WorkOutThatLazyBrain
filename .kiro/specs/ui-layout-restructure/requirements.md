# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature restructures the game's user interface layout to improve the visual hierarchy and user experience. The current prototype layout needs to be reorganized so that the information panel (showing solution progress and game stats) is positioned at the top center of the screen, with the game tiles positioned below it in a more structured layout.

## Glossary

- **Information Panel**: The UI component that displays solution progress, total solutions found, and game statistics
- **Game Tiles**: The interactive card elements that players click to form mathematical expressions
- **Layout System**: The CSS and component structure that controls the positioning and spacing of UI elements
- **Viewport**: The visible area of the game interface within the browser or app container

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the information panel to be prominently displayed at the top center of the screen, so that I can easily see my progress and game statistics without it interfering with gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads, THE Layout_System SHALL position the information panel at the top center of the viewport
2. WHEN the viewport is resized, THE Layout_System SHALL maintain the information panel's centered position at the top
3. WHEN the information panel is displayed, THE Layout_System SHALL ensure it remains visible and accessible at all times during gameplay
4. WHEN the information panel is positioned, THE Layout_System SHALL provide adequate spacing between the panel and other UI elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game tiles to be positioned below the information panel with proper spacing, so that I can interact with them comfortably without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game tiles are rendered, THE Layout_System SHALL position them below the information panel with appropriate vertical spacing
2. WHEN the game tiles are displayed, THE Layout_System SHALL center them horizontally within the available space
3. WHEN the layout is applied, THE Layout_System SHALL ensure game tiles do not overlap with the information panel
4. WHEN the game tiles are positioned, THE Layout_System SHALL maintain their interactive functionality and visual clarity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the layout to be responsive across different screen sizes, so that the game remains playable and visually appealing on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is viewed on mobile devices, THE Layout_System SHALL adapt the spacing and positioning to fit smaller screens
2. WHEN the game is viewed on desktop devices, THE Layout_System SHALL utilize the available space effectively while maintaining visual hierarchy
3. WHEN the screen orientation changes, THE Layout_System SHALL adjust the layout to maintain usability
4. WHEN the viewport size changes, THE Layout_System SHALL ensure both the information panel and game tiles remain fully visible and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the visual hierarchy to be clear and intuitive, so that I can focus on gameplay while easily accessing game information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layout is rendered, THE Layout_System SHALL establish a clear visual hierarchy with the information panel as the primary reference point
2. WHEN elements are positioned, THE Layout_System SHALL use consistent spacing and alignment principles throughout the interface
3. WHEN the game is in progress, THE Layout_System SHALL ensure the information panel draws appropriate attention without being distracting
4. WHEN the layout is complete, THE Layout_System SHALL provide a clean, organized appearance that enhances the gaming experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the layout system to be maintainable and flexible, so that future UI changes can be implemented efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layout code is structured, THE Layout_System SHALL use modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox or CSS Grid) for positioning
2. WHEN layout styles are defined, THE Layout_System SHALL separate layout concerns from component-specific styling
3. WHEN the layout is implemented, THE Layout_System SHALL use semantic HTML structure that supports accessibility
4. WHEN layout changes are needed, THE Layout_System SHALL allow modifications without requiring extensive refactoring of existing components
