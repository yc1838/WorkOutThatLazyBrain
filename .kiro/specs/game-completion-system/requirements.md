# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a game completion system to the Reddit Devvit math game that shows the total number of possible solutions and provides a celebration experience when players find all combinations. The system will enhance user engagement by providing clear progress indicators and a satisfying completion experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see how many total solutions are possible for the current game, so that I can understand my progress and know when I'm close to completing the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new game starts THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the total number of possible solutions
2. WHEN the game is in progress THEN the system SHALL show "X of Y solutions found" where X is found solutions and Y is total possible solutions
3. WHEN the total solutions count is calculated THEN the system SHALL use the existing game logic to determine all valid combinations
4. IF there are no valid solutions for a target number THEN the system SHALL regenerate the game with a different target or card set

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a celebration when I find all possible solutions, so that I feel accomplished and motivated to play again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player finds all possible solutions THEN the system SHALL display a congratulations message
2. WHEN the game is completed THEN the system SHALL show celebration visual effects or styling
3. WHEN the completion celebration is shown THEN the system SHALL disable further card interactions
4. WHEN the game is completed THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "Start New Game" option
5. WHEN the player clicks "Start New Game" after completion THEN the system SHALL reset all game state and generate a new game

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to prevent me from continuing to click cards after I've found all solutions, so that the completion state is clear and I'm guided to start a new game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all solutions are found THEN the system SHALL disable card click interactions
2. WHEN all solutions are found THEN the system SHALL visually indicate that cards are no longer interactive
3. WHEN cards are disabled THEN the system SHALL not process any new card selections
4. WHEN cards are disabled THEN the system SHALL maintain the visual state of the last valid selection until a new game starts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my progress clearly throughout the game, so that I can track how close I am to completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game displays solutions THEN the system SHALL show the current count alongside the total possible count
2. WHEN a new solution is found THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicator immediately
3. WHEN the progress reaches 100% THEN the system SHALL trigger the completion celebration
4. WHEN the progress is displayed THEN the system SHALL use clear, readable formatting like "3 of 5 solutions found"
